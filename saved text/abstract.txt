Abstract

Superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) is @ chronic, bilateral epithelial keratitis Dr Philips

Thygeson first reported SPK in 1950 Although the ctiology of SPK remains unknown, It has
been reported to be associated with viral and autoimmune ologies. The disease course 1s
characterized by exacerbations and remissions. The clagsfcal finding on,slit lamp examination

is the presence of distinctive coarse, raised, oval-swaped cornea) epithelium lesions Patients
commonly present with ocular irritation an rarely with rediiced visual acuity Topical
corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment orfosergomm nly used treatments included
topical cyclosporine, contact lensesan@ corneal laser

Key Words: Superficial punctate keratitis, Epithelial keratitis, Punctate keratitis

Introduction

The term superficial punctate keratitis was { used to describe an epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis in 1889 by Dr Ernst Fuchs-that was likely caused by a strain of adenovirus
In 1950, Dr Phillips Thygeson, an ophthalmologist from California, reported 26 cases of
distinctive punctate epithelial fitis, which later came to be known as Thygeson's superficial
punctate keratitis (TSPK) In 1961, Dr Thygeson described another 29 cases and proposed the
diagnostic features of TSPK to differentiate TSPK from other forms of epithelial keratopathies
These included, chronic bilateral punctate epithelial keratitis, king duration with remissions
and exacerbations, eventual healing without scars, lack offesponse to antibiotics, and striking
response tc topical corticosteroids. Jones was thg/irst to suggest in 1963 that superficial
punctate keratitis should formally be called Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis
Superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) is a safe, transient disease of the cornea with a chroni¢ and
recurrent course of exacerbations gnd remissions with an insidious onset The average duration
varies from 3 to 7 years, but aduration up to 41 years has been described. The prevalence of
SPK is unknown It can occur at every age and has no sey-fredilection No specific systemic
or ocular infection is associated to SPK Both~eyes are frequently involved, often
asymmetrically, but unilateral involvement ha€ been reported too Patients complain of
recurrent episodes of foreign body sensajof with ocular irritation, teanng, photophobia and
blurred vision SPK frequently saan decrease in visual acuity with impact on daily
activities It 1s characterized by transient, granular opacities in the superficial cornea The
